# Leaf Disease Detection


This application uses the TFLite plugin for Flutter to run a TFLite model on the device. The pretrained model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) that is used to detect leaf diseases. The user can pick an image from the gallery or take a new photo using the camera, and the app will display the detected disease.
